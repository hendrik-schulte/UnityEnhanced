# UnityEnhanced
A set of useful tools aimed at easy and powerful architecture in Unity3D based on ScriptableObjects! In short, you use references to asset files rather than wiring up all objects in your scene directly. This leads to loosely coupled modules in your scene and code that is much easier to debug and maintain. See [this great talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raQ3iHhE_Kk) of Ryan Hipple at the Unite 2017 to get introduced to the concept. This library includes an extended implementation of the tools presented in the talk and much more.

## Requirements

- Unity 2017.1+
- .NET 4.6 or above

## Setup

### Installation using UPM (only in Unity 2018.3+)

1. Edit \Packages\manifest.json in your project folder
2. Add the following line to the list of *dependencies*:
```json
"com.unityenhanced": "https://github.com/hendrik-schulte/UnityEnhanced.git",
```
3. UPM should now install UnityEnhanced
4. *Optional:* Select the right version for Photon / SharpConfig integration 

### Installation as Git submodule

Alternatively, add the package as a git submodule in your project.

In Sourcetree:
- Click Repository > Add Submodule ...
- As Source Path / URL you specify: 

``` 
git@github.com:hendrik-schulte/UnityEnhanced.git
```

- Set Local Relative Path to:

``` 
Assets/UnityEnhanced
``` 

- Pull submodule

### Manual Installation

Copy content of this repository to a folder named *UnityEnhanced* inside of your asset folder.

### Assembly Definition

The package includes [Assembly Definition Files](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ScriptCompilationAssemblyDefinitionFiles.html). Since the Photon Networking package is optional, you may need to add or remove Photon as reference in the assembly definition. Or you can simply delete all *.asmdef* files.
